## Train Management System

The Train Management System is a C language-based application that provides both user and admin panels for managing train-related tasks. The system enables users to book tickets, verify tickets, and view train details. On the other hand, administrators can add new trains, update train details/status, and view passenger details.

## Features

User Panel
Ticket Booking: Users can book train tickets by providing necessary information such as source, destination, date, and number of passengers.

Verifying Tickets: Users can verify their booked tickets using the unique ticket number or any other relevant identifier.

View Train Details: Users can view the details of all available trains, including train number, name, source, destination, departure time, and arrival time.

Admin Panel
Add New Trains: Administrators can add new trains to the system by entering train details, such as train number, name, source, destination, departure time, and arrival time.

Update Train Details/Status: Admins have the authority to update train details and status. This includes modifying train information and marking a train as delayed, canceled, or any other relevant status.

View Passenger Details: Administrators can access passenger details for all booked tickets, including passenger names, ages, and contact information.
